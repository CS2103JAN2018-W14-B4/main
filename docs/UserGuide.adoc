== Introduction

CelebManager (CM) is for celebrity managers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their celebrity's schedule with ease*. More importantly, CM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you require a versatile application that has the feature of *managing contacts, organising schedules, emailing (Coming in v2.0) and trip planning*. You are at the right place as CM would be the best platform for you, with its integration of address book, calendar and visual maps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Features

For each of the command in our app, their formats follow some general patterns as mentioned in the text box below.

====
*Command Format*

* Some commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add a person to CelebManager, you can type either `add n/John Doe` or `a n/John Doe`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
