== Introduction

CelebManager (CM) is for celebrity managers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their celebrity's schedule
with ease*. More importantly, CM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you require a versatile application that has the
feature of *managing contacts, organising schedules, emailing (Coming in v2.0) and trip planning*. You are at the right
place as CM would be the best platform for you, with its integration of address book, calendar and visual maps.

For each of the command in CelebManager, their formats follow some general patterns as mentioned in the text box below.

you can type either `add n/John Doe` or `a n/John Doe`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which
can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
