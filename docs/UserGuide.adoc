== Introduction

CelebManager (CM) is for celebrity managers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their celebrity's schedule
with ease*. More importantly, CM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you require a versatile application that has the
feature of *managing contacts, organising schedules, emailing (Coming in v2.0) and trip planning*. You are at the right
place as CM would be the best platform for you, with its integration of address book, calendar and visual maps.

[[Features]]
== Features

For each of the command in CelebManager, their formats follow some general patterns as mentioned in the text box below.

====
*Command Format*

* Some commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add a person to CelebManager,
you can type either `add n/John Doe` or `a n/John Doe`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which
can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
acceptable.
====

====
*Precaution*

* You should not click inside the calendar at all times, except for scrolling up and down using the scroll bar.
* Commands that modify the people and appointments stored in CelebManager (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `undo`, `redo`,
`addAppointment`) must be performed in combined calendar view unless specified otherwise. +
Information about combined calendar view can be found in +
<<Changing to view the combined calendar: `viewCombinedCalendar` [Since v1.3]>>.
