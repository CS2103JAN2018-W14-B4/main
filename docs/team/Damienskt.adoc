== PROJECT: CelebManager

---

== Overview

CelebManager is a software application that aims to allow celebrity managers to maintain schedule of celebrities under them. CelebManager is optimized for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visual feedback.

In this software, the users should be able to:

.   Manage contacts
.	Manage appointments
.	Manage calendars
.	Plan efficient routes

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to show location in map*
** What it does: Allow the celebrity manager to have a view of the exact location in a map. Notify celebrity manager if a location cannot be found on the map.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing the celebrity manager to be familiar with the location.
 This is important as they are responsible of ensuring that their celebrities reaches the correct location for their appointment.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
 The implementation was challenging as it requires a clear understanding of the external libraries used and how the libraries function integrates with the existing structure.
** Credits: Third party library used, which are `GMAPSFX API` and  `Google Maps Web Services API` library which can be found http://rterp.github.io/GMapsFX/apidocs/[here] and https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.2.6/javadoc/[here] respectively.

=== ShowLocation Feature
==== Current Implementation

The ShowLocation mechanism is facilitated by the `ShowLocationCommand`, which resides inside `Logic`. It supports the viewing of location
in the `MapPanel` by updating the state of the `MapPanel`. This is done by re-centering the `MapPanel` to the latitude and longitude of the
location and identifying it with a location marker. This command inherits from `Command` so it *does not support the undo/redo feature*.

The following figure shows the marker that is used to identify the location in the `MapPanel`:

.Location marker
image::LocationMarker.png[width="50"]

The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for `ShowLocationCommand`:

.Inheritance diagram for `Command`
image::ShowLocationLogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width=""]

As you can see from the diagram, `ShowLocationCommand` inherits from the Command class and is not part of the Undoable Command.
Similar to the other commands like `FindCommand` *it will not be identified by the undo/redo feature*.

This command does not use the `Person` `Address` model to search for a specific location, it uses the `MapAddress` model. This is due to
 the difference in address specification details as the `Address` model is too specific for the command to work.
An example would be the details of unit number (e.g #11-111) which will result in an invalid command or inaccurate result.

The main difference between both model is shown below in the two code snippets.

The snippet code below shows the `Address` model:

[source,java]
----
public class Address {
    public static final String MESSAGE_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINTS =
                "Person addresses can take any values, and it should not be blank";
    /*
     * The first character of the address must not be a whitespace,
     * otherwise " " (a blank string) becomes a valid input.
     */
    public static final String ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[^\\s].*";
    /**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid person email.
     */
    public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
        return test.matches(ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
    ...
}
----

The snippet code below shows the `MapAddress` model:

[source,java]
----
public class MapAddress {
    public static final String MESSAGE_ADDRESS_MAP_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Address should be in location name, road name, block and road name or postal code format.\n"
                    + "Note:(Person address may not be valid as it consist of too many details like unit number)"
    /*
     * The first character of the address must not be a whitespace,
     * otherwise " " (a blank string) becomes a valid input.
     */
    public static final String ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[^\\s].*";
    ...
    /**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid map address.
     */
    public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
        boolean isValid;
        Geocoding testAddress = new Geocoding();
        isValid = testAddress.checkIfAddressCanBeFound(test);
        return test.matches(ADDRESS_MAP_VALIDATION_REGEX) && isValid;
    }
    ...
}
----
The difference to note is the `isValidAddress` method, where `Address` only checks for *blank space* whereas `MapAddress`
checks for *blank space and the validity of location in google server*. Thus, making the command more restrictive to location,
 road, block name and postal code. Any details more than that, would result in a higher possibility of it being invalid or inaccurate.

This command uses the `GMAPSFX API` and  `Google Maps Web Services API` library which can be found http://rterp.github.io/GMapsFX/apidocs/[here] and https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.2.6/javadoc/[here] respectively.

* `GMAPSFX API` is used to create the `MapPanel` class which allows the
command to re-center and mark the new location which is then shown to the user.

* `Google Maps Web Services API` is used to create the
`Geocoding` class, which is used to convert `MapAddress` into latitude and longitude form (`LatLng`). The `LatLng` form
is then used by the command to find the exact location in the `MapPanel`.

Every new input of this command will remove the previous route or location marker and add the new marker into the map.

The snippet below shows the state of `MapPanel` before input of `ShowLocation` command:

.Default State of `MapPanel`
image::BeforeInputMap.png[width="400"]

After the input of "showLocation ma/Punggol" the `MapPanel` will be updated to the diagram below:

.State of `MapPanel` after `CommandInput`
image::AfterShowLocationInput.png[width="400"]

Any subsequent inputs will remove the previous location marker and update the `MapPanel` with the new marker.

[NOTE]
Whenever an invalid `showlocation` command is done, any existing location marker or route will be removed from the map.

The following sequence diagram shows how the command works:

.Sequence Diagram of `showLocation` Command
image::ShowLocationSequenceDiagram.png[width=""]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `showLocationCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend `Command`
** Pros: Allows new developers to understand easily as the command is at the same abstraction level as other commands.
** Cons: Does not have the undo/redo feature as it is not part of `UndoableCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Extend `UndoableCommand`
** Pros: Allows for command to have the undo/redo function.
** Cons: Requires more work that may not fit in with our timeline

===== Aspect: Use of address model
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `MapAddress`
** Pros: Allows the clear distinction of requirements between `MapAddress` and `Address` to avoid confusion
** Cons: Confusing as both `MapAddress` and `Address` model are quite similar.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Address`
** Pros: Reduces the amount of code/class in the project
** Cons: Confusing as different requirements for a single model. Lacks proper organisation.

=== EstimateRoute Feature
==== Current Implementation

The EstimateRoute mechanism is facilitated by the `EstimateRouteCommand`, which resides inside `Logic`. It supports the viewing of estimated route
in the `MapPanel` by updating the state of the `MapPanel`. This is done by re-centering the `MapPanel` to the new route.



The following figure shows the marker that is used to identify the start and end location in the `MapPanel`:

.Start Location marker
image::Start_Location_Marker.png[width="100"]

.End Location marker
image::End_Location_Marker.png[width="100"]

`EstimateRouteCommand` inherits from the Command class and is not part of the Undoable Command.
Similar to the other commands like `FindCommand` *it will not be identified by the undo/redo feature*.

This command is similar to the `ShowLocation` feature which does not use the `Person` `Address` model to search for a specific location, it uses the `MapAddress` model. This is due to the difference in address specification details as the `Address` model is too specific for the command to work.
Even if it works the results may not be accurate.
An example would be the details of unit number (e.g #11-111) which will result in an invalid command or inaccurate results.

This command uses the `GMAPSFX API` and  `Google Maps Web Services API` library which can be found http://rterp.github.io/GMapsFX/apidocs/[here] and https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.2.6/javadoc/[here] respectively.

* `GMAPSFX` is used to create the `MapPanel` which allows the
command to re-center the map view, create the route, mark the start and end location which is then shown to the user.

* `Google Maps Web Services API` is used to create the
`Geocoding` class, which is used to convert `MapAddress` into latitude and longitude form (`LatLng`). The `LatLng` form
is then used by the command to find the exact location in the `MapPanel`.

* `Google Maps Web Services API` is also used to create the `DistanceEstimate` class, which allows
the calculation of estimated time and distance of travel between two location by driving. `DistanceEstimate` class is also used to check if two locations
can be reached by driving.

The snippet below shows the state of `MapPanel` before input of `estimateRoute` command:

.Default State of `MapPanel`
image::BeforeInputMap.png[width="400"]

After the input of "estimateRoute sma/Punggol ema/NUS" the `MapPanel` will be updated to the diagram below:

.State of `MapPanel` after `CommandInput`
image::AfterEstimateRouteInput.png[width="400"]

Any subsequent `estimateRoute` command will remove any existing marker or route before updating the `MapPanel` with the new route.

[NOTE]
Whenever an invalid `estimateRoute` command is done, any existing location marker or route will be removed from the map.

The following sequence diagram shows how the command works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `estimateCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend `Command`
** Pros: Allows new developers to understand easily as the command is at the same abstraction level as other commands.
** Cons: Does not have the undo/redo feature as it is not part of `UndoableCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Extend `UndoableCommand`
** Pros: Allows for command to have the undo/redo function.
** Cons: Requires more work that may not fit in with our timeline.

===== Aspect: Use of address model
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `MapAddress`
** Pros: Allows the clear distinction of requirements between `MapAddress` and `Address` to avoid confusion.
** Cons: Confusing as the two models are similar.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Address`
** Pros: Reduces the amount of code/class in the project.
** Cons: Confusing as different requirements for a single model. Lacks proper organisation.

===== Aspect: Input using appointment index
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Location` name
** Pros: Allows the function to be used independently
** Cons: Requires keying in of location instead of just an index.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Appointment` index
** Pros: Reduces the amount of typing.
** Cons: Restricts the use of function as without an appointment index you will not be able to use it.

=== ViewAppointment Feature
==== Current Implementation
The ViewAppointment mechanism is facilitated by the `ViewAppointmentCommand`, which resides inside `Logic`. It supports the viewing of a specific appointment
in the `ResultDisplayPanel`  by displaying the `Appointment` details. The specific `Appointment` is selected using an index based on the list generated by `ListAppointmentCommand`.
 This command inherits from `Command` so it *does not support the undo/redo feature*.

The input index is *one-based* which means that the smallest possible index is '1' and the largest possible index is the size of list
generated by `ListAppointmentCommand` (total number of `Appointment`).

As this command relies on the list generated by `ListAppointmentCommand`, the command retrieves the start (earliest) and end (latest) date
from `ListAppointmentCommand`, which is used to generate the appointment list internally from the `StorageCalendar` in `Model`.
This is done by `getChosenAppointment()` method.

The snippet code below shows the code that retrieves the selected appointment.
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        selectedAppointment = model.getChosenAppointment(chosenIndex);
        try {
            ShowLocationCommand showLocation = new ShowLocationCommand(
                    new MapAddress(selectedAppointment.getLocation()));
            showLocation.execute();
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS + getAppointmentDetailsResult());
        } catch (NullPointerException npe) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS + getAppointmentDetailsResult());
        }
    }
----

To show the location in the `MapPanel`, `ShowLocationCommand` is used to update the location marker in `MapPanel` to
point to the `Appointment` location.

In the case where the `Appointment` do not have any location data, the result will still be displayed without the
location being shown in the map.

[NOTE]
Whenever an `Appointment` has no location data, any existing location marker or route will be removed from the map.

The diagram below in figure 32 shows the sequence diagram of `ViewAppointmentCommand`.

.Sequence Diagram of `viewAppointment` Command
image::ViewAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png[width=""]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `viewAppointment`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend `Command`
** Pros: Easy to understand for new developers who will be developing this project as the command is at the same abstraction level as other commands.
** Cons: Does not have the undo/redo feature as it is not part of `UndoableCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Extend `UndoableCommand`
** Pros: Allows for command to have the undo/redo function.
** Cons: Requires more work that may not fit in with our timeline.

===== Aspect: Inclusion of showing location on map
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show location of appointment on map
** Pros: Reduces the hassle of keying an extra command to show `Appointment` location on map.
** Cons: Reduces independent usage of `ShowLocationCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Does not show location on map
** Pros: Reduces unnecessary showing of location.
** Cons: Requires an extra command input to show location when required.
