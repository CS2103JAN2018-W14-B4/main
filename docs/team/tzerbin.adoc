== PROJECT: CelebManager

---

== Overview

CelebManager is a software application that aims to allow celebrity managers to maintain schedule of celebrities under them. CelebManager is optimized for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visual feedback.

In this software, the users should be able to:

.   Manage contacts
.	Manage appointments
.	Manage calendars
.	Plan efficient routes

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Provide functionalities for storing calendar and appointment data
** What it does: Allow functionalities for celebrity manager to automaticallly save appointments in an .xml file, and read appointments data from a .xml file to run the application.

** Justification: This feature allows other components to communicate with `Storage` component so that other features related to appointments can be saved and retrieved.

** Highlights: This feature affects commands related to appointments, and commands to be added in future.

=== Introduction

CelebManager (CM) is for celebrity managers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their celebrity's schedule
with ease*. More importantly, CM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you require a versatile application that has the
feature of *managing contacts, organising schedules, emailing (Coming in v2.0) and trip planning*. You are at the right
place as CM would be the best platform for you, with its integration of address book, calendar and visual maps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== Quick Start

Follow this series of steps to have the CelebManager app quickly up and running on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer. The link to the latest version of Java
can be found
https://java.com/en/download/[here].
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CelebManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The interface should appear in a few seconds.
+
The image below (Figure 1) shows the current interface of CelebManager.

=== Storage Component

The following diagram shows the class diagram of the `Storage` component.
It describes how the overall structure of the `Storage` component and its different sub-components.

.Class diagram of the `Storage` component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* saves contacts data in xml format and read it back.
* saves appointments data in xml format and read it back.

=== Appointment Storage Feature
==== Current Implementation
The storing of appointment is facilitated by the `XmlStorageCalendarStorage` class, which resides in the `Storage` component.
It supports the retrieval and storage for appointments made by the user.

During start-up of application, the storage component will be initialized by the `MainApp`, which retrieves information from the specified file path in `UserPrefs`.

The following code snippet shows how the storage component will be initialized by the `MainApp`.
[source,java]
----
public void init() throws Exception {
        // initializes application.

        UserPrefsStorage userPrefsStorage = new JsonUserPrefsStorage(config.getUserPrefsFilePath());
        userPrefs = initPrefs(userPrefsStorage);
        AddressBookStorage addressBookStorage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(userPrefs.getAddressBookFilePath());
        StorageCalendarStorage storageCalendarStorage =
                new XmlStorageCalendarStorage(userPrefs.getStorageCalendarFilePath());
        storage = new StorageManager(addressBookStorage, userPrefsStorage, storageCalendarStorage);

        // initializes other component in the application.
    }
----

The following figure shows the sequence diagram for reading `StorageCalendar`.

.Sequence Diagram for reading `StorageCalendar`
image::ReadStorageCalendarSequenceDiagram.png[width=""]

In the `XmlStorageCalendarStorage` class, it allows developers to use methods:

* `readStorageCalendar`, to retrieve a `StorageCalendar`
** This is done by checking if the file exist, and load the list from `XmlSerializableStorageCalendar`.
* `saveStorageCalendar`, to write information into `filePath` specified in `userPrefs`
** This is done by creating a new file and rewriting to the list in `XmlSerializableStorageCalendar`.

While the `XmlStorageCalendarStorage` class allows access to data stored on the hard disk, the `XmlSerializableStorageCalendar` class represents the data of the appointment list for the calendar.
In `XmlSerializableStorageCalendar`, it contains a `List` of XML formats of appointments `XmlAdaptedAppointment`.
`XmlAdaptedAppointment` will then contain essential information of different `Appointment` in `StorageCalendar` of the `Model` component, which includes:

* `title` of appointment
* `startTime` of appointment indicating its starting time
* `startDate` of appointment indicating its starting date
* `endTime` of appointment indicating its ending time
* `endDate` of appointment indicating its ending date
* `location` of appointment that is going to happen
* `celebrityIds` of celebrities that are attending the appointment
* `pointOfContactIds` of non-celebrities that are attending the appointment
